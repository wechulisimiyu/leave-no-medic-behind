                    participants to join different teams, compete and get points
                    which will contribute to the team’s final score on race day.
                    Our gane nights will also provide a great opportunity for you
                    to learn more about the amazing organizations and companies
                    who are sponsoring the 2023 charity run. Stay tuned to AMSUN

                    We will begin with a short warm up session followed by the
                    official flag off. After the run, we will have a cool-down
                    session and an amazing entertainment program with fun games,
                    music and performances. We will also have a great line-up of
                    vendors and exhibitors! This will be the experience of a
                    lifetime! You definitely don’t want to miss it.

            The
            <b><u class="text-info">Leave No Medic Behind Initiative Charity Run</u></b>
            is a fundraising project by the Association of Medical Students of the
            University of Nairobi (AMSUN) to meet the financial needs of
            underprivileged students in the School of Medicine. It began in 2017
            when the then 5th year medical school class had a classmate who was
            almost denied to sit for their end of year exams because of a fees
            balance of less than sh 20,000. His classmates rallied together, each
            giving what they could and with that the student was able to sit for
            his exams and hence Leave No Medic Behind (LNMB) was born. Initially,
            LNMB primarily did student-centered fund raising using the harambee
            model however in 2022, there emerged the idea to organise for a
            charity run. The inaugural 2022 charity run was a huge success with
            over 650 t-shirts being sold and about 550 attendees coming for the
            run. The 2nd annual LNMB charity run will take place on 29th April
            2023 and it is definitely going to be bigger and better.

            Tributes from the AMSUN Leadership
          </h4>
          <p>
            We have lost a beacon of hope to our community. The late Amayo Mordecai was a finalist MBChB student, and a
            1st Class Honors graduate from the BSc. Medical Physiology programme from the faculty of health sciences. 

            He utilised his gifts and talents to benefit us all. He was a good man with a caring heart, and he dedicated
            much of his time and efforts in tutoring hundreds of fellow medical students in Physiology over the years.
            He cared deeply about improving healthcare in our nation, and he spearheaded numerous projects aimed at
            developing digital solutions for patient record keeping, for diagnosing diseases through imaging, and for
            analysing trends in patient data to draw useful inferences for their management and care. But he did neither
            of this alone, and he has mentored multiple students and engaged with multiple lecturers and professors from
            our institution to actualize this dream; his loss is a blow to us all.
